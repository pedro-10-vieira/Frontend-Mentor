## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned an efficient and clean way of creating a simple HTML/CSS project involving a container with an image and text


### Continued development

In future projects, I'll continue focusing in putting into practice my theoretical knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript (from the moment it also becomes a requirement), improving my pace and accuracy when I'm coding

### Useful resources

The project was super simple, so, no major resourses used
